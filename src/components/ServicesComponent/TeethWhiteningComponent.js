                            <p className="dental-problem">Tooth whitening lightens teeth and helps to remove teeth stain and discoloration. Whitening is among the most popular cosmetic dental procedures because it can greatly improve how your teeth look. Most dentists perform tooth whitening.<br></br>
                               When your teeth are professionally whitened the only thing that changes is their color. The strength, health or structure of the teeth is never affected. It primarily focuses on the improvement of the overall smile appearance. Whitening is not a one-time procedure. It will need to be repeated from time to time if you want to maintain the brighter color.</p>

                            <p className="tooth-decay-font">The outer layer of a tooth is called the enamel. The color of natural teeth is created by the reflection and scattering of light off the enamel, combined with the color of the dentin under it. Your genes affect the thickness and smoothness of the enamel. Thinner enamel allows more of the color of the dentin to show through. Having smoother or rougher enamel also affects the reflection of light and therefore the color. Every day, a thin coating (pellicle) forms on the enamel and picks up stains. Tooth enamel also contains pores that can hold stains.</p>
                            <p className="tooth-decay-font">The most common reasons for teeth to get yellow or stained are:</p>
                            <p className="tooth-decay-font">1. Using tobacco,</p>
                            <p className="tooth-decay-font">2. Drinking dark-colored liquids such as coffee, cola, tea and red wine,</p>
                            <p className="tooth-decay-font">3. Not taking good care of your teeth.</p>
